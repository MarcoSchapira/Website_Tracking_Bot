# Queen's University Housing Monitor

## Background
In the Queen's University student district, rental houses operate on a first-come, first-served basis. As a result, property management websites are constantly monitored by students, and houses are often taken immediately after being posted.

## Project Overview
This script was developed to tackle this competitive housing market by:

- Monitoring the main housing websites multiple times per minute.
- Alerting via email as soon as a new property is listed.

By automating the monitoring process, you can be among the first to know about new rental listings, giving you a competitive edge in securing housing.
